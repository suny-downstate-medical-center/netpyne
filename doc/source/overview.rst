NetPyNE Overview
=======================================

What is NetPyNE?
----------------

NetPyNE (Network development Python package for NEURON) is a python package to facilitate the development, parallel simulation and analysis of biological neuronal networks using the NEURON simulator.
Although NEURON already enables multiscale simulation ranging from the molecular to the network level, NEURON for networks, often requiring parallel simulations, requires substantial programming. NetPyNE greatly facilitates the development and parallel simulation of biological neuronal networks in NEURON for experimentalists.  NetPyNe is also intended for experienced modelers, providing powerful features to incorporate complex anatomical and physiological data into models.

See our recent `poster at the Computational Neuroscience conference CNS16 <http://neurosimlab.org/salvadord/CNS16_poster.pdf>`_ for a nice overview!

What can I do with NetPyNE?
---------------------------

NetPyNE converts a set of high-level specifications into a NEURON model. Specifications are provided in a simple, standardized, declarative format, based solely on Python’s lists and dictionaries. The user can define network populations and their properties, including cell type, number or density. For each cell type, the user can define morphology, biophysics and implementation, or choose to import these from existing files (HOC templates or Python classes). Cell models for each population can be easily changed, and several models can be combined to generate efficient hybrid networks, *e.g.,* composed of Hodgkin-Huxley multicompartment cells and Izhikevich point neurons. 

NetPyNE provides a flexible format to specify connectivity, with rules based on pre- and post-synaptic cell properties, such as cell type or location. Multiple connectivity functions are available, including all-to-all, probabilistic, convergent or divergent. Additionally, connectivity parameters (*e.g.,* weight, probability or delay) can be specified as a function of pre/post-synaptic spatial properties. This enables implementation of complex biological patterns, such as delays or connection probabilities that depend on distance between cells, or weights that depend on the post-synaptic neuron’s cortical depth. The subcellular distribution of synapses along the dendrites can be specified, and is automatically adapted to the morphology of each model neuron. Learning mechanisms, including spike-timing dependent plasticity and reinforcement learning, can be readily incorporated.

Using the high-level network specifications, NetPyNE instantiates the full model (all cells and connections) as a hierarchical Python structure including the NEURON objects necessary for simulation. Based on a set of simulation options (*e.g.,* duration, integration step), NetPyNE runs the model in parallel using MPI, eliminating the burdensome task of manually distributing the workload and gathering data across computing nodes. Optionally NetPyNE plots output data, such as spike raster plots, LFP power spectra, connectivity matrix, or intrinsic time-varying variables (*e.g.,* voltage) of any subset of cells. To facilitate data sharing, the package saves and loads the high-level specifications, instantiated network, and simulation results using common file formats (Pickle, Matlab, JSON or HDF5). NetPyNE can convert instantiated networks to and from NeuroML, a standard data format for exchanging models in computational neuroscience.

NetPyNE has been used to develop a variety of multiscale models: primary motor cortex with cortical depth-dependent connectivity; the claustrum; and sensorimotor cortex that learns to control a virtual arm. The package is easily installed via pip, and includes comprehensive online documentation, a step-by-step tutorial and example networks.
