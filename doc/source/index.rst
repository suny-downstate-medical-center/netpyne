Welcome to the NetPyNE homepage!
================================

NetPyNE is an open-source Python package to facilitate the development, parallel simulation, analysis, and optimization of biological neuronal networks using the NEURON simulator. See our recent `publication in eLife <https://elifesciences.org/articles/44494>`_ for more details.
 
To make NetPyNE more accessible, we have released a (beta version) graphical user interface (GUI).  The GUI is freely available at `gui.netpyne.org <http://gui.netpyne.org>`_ with documentation `here <https://github.com/Neurosim-lab/NetPyNE-UI/wiki>`_.

For a detailed overview of NetPyNE, including an interactive tutorial utilizing the GUI, please see our `CNS*2020 <https://www.cnsorg.org/cns-2020>`_
tutorial: **Building mechanistic multiscale models: from molecules to networks using NEURON and NetPyNE**.  The complete video is available `here <https://yale.zoom.us/rec/play/tMAkcrr8-jo3HNCU4wSDUaR8W427LaKs1HAW_aUPzkmzUSJRO1WnY7cXZep77NjtCLWqwFVD6Ya8aNTL?continueMode=true&_x_zm_rtaid=J63YcHJGT9CUEjhkklHizQ.1598553844678.e87215956b2d8a50ef33ec4d6479b3b2&_x_zm_rhtaid=388>`_ and slides are available `here <http://bit.ly/cns20-netpyne>`_.

Check out our latest tutorial: **Virtual Environments, Jupyter Notebooks, and NetPyNE basics**.  The video is available `here <https://youtu.be/TV7ipuDHBd0>`_ and the notebook is available `here <https://github.com/Neurosim-lab/netpyne/blob/development/netpyne/tutorials/netpyne_tut1/netpyne_tut1.ipynb>`_ .
