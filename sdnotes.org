* 15may27 Modularized framework for NEURON/Python network simulations with MPI
** Overview
Using this modularized structure can select different cell types, populations, connectivities, etc. just by modifying the
parameters in params.py. 

An example is provided in params.py which switches from a single Hodgkin-Huxley population, randomly connected model
(mpiHHTut); to a multiple Izhikevich populations, yfrac-dependent connected M1 model.

To test this just modify the variable simType in params.py: 
simType = 'M1model' # 'mpiHHTut' 

*** Bill's description of what this repo should be
we should try to make this our main organizational code that can spin off multiple projects? -- would like a clean code center-org so that not so painful as it has been with our prior code base (which btw was all my fault and not sam's -- he inherited from me)
then any pushes back to this main center would have to be agreed by curator (you) and would generally involve just some small fix to a single file

** README with description of the different files
List of files:

- main.py: Main executable; calls functions from other modules.

- params.py: Contains all static parameters. It is imported as "p" from all other modules, so that params can be referenced from any file using p.paramName

- shared.py: Contains all the model shared variables and modules (except params.py). It is imported as "s" from all other file, so that any variable or module can be referenced from any file using s.varName

- sim.py: Simulation control functions (eg. runSim)

- network.py: Network related functions (eg. createCells)

- cell.py: contains cell and population classes 

- conn.py: contains class 'Conn' used to instantiate connections, and contains methods to connect cells (eg. random, yfrac-based)

- analysis.py: functions to plot and analyse data

- stimuli.py: functions and parameters for differnt types of neural stimulation

- izhi2007.mod: NMODL definition of Izhikevich 2007 neuron model

- evol.py: Functions to run evolutionary algorithms (using inspyred) to optimize model parameters

** Known issues, potential improvements, and alternative implementations (outdated - see TODO list at end of file)
*** TODO - Saving only happens at the end (instead of at fixed intervals)
*** TODO - Need to add a DEBUG mode or similar (like mpiHHTut had)
- currently have a verbose flag, that prints some additional info
- also have print messages along the code, which could be made optional
*** TODO - Check structure of data saved to file
- some nested lists with inhomogeneous dimensionality were converted to 'object' data types in order to be saved -- check if
  structure makes sense when reading from python/matlab
*** DONE - Some attributes/variables of the class 'Cell' and 'Pop' are not used but still initialized to [ ]
- maybe can find alternative using different constructors for different cell types
- fixed by using dictionary of tags - flexible for eahc type
*** DONE - Labels (eg. AMPA, IT, HH,...) are defined by assigning numeric values to variables
- can use dictionaries instead
- need to check pros and cons of each -- are dicts slower or have any limitations compared to lists/arrays ?
- changed to using dictionaries
*** TODO - stimuli.py not tested with this model
- left there cause thought could be useful for future
*** TODO - analysis.py still has many functions which havent been adapted to new structure
*** TODO - Some variables inherited from cliff still have too long names, eg. backgroundSpikevec
*** TODO - Lines too long, need to split using \
*** DONE - if increase p.backgroundNoise > 0.0 get memory error 
- had to store rnadom noise generator separately for each cell
*** DONE - Find a way to save lambda funcs (can't be pickled)
can use:
>>>import inspect 
>>>inspect.getsource(myfunc)
*** DONE - Clearing vector in simdata now gives error because also has python variables
for v in s.simdata.itervalues() -- fix error
separated vectors
*** TODO - 'Cell' class record method uses eval() which is unsafe
*** DONE - currently setup to record traces from all cells
*** DONE - bug when saving cell traces using multiple cores 
Gathering spikes...

    for d in gather: tmp.extend(d[k]) 
KeyError: 'cellTraces_233'

- now saved using different structure 
- had to remove hoc objects that are not pickable


*** TODO - Load/save net+sim parameters from file
- load net and sim parameters file from mat?
- have different .py file to generate the params files

within params.py - have option to load from file, or set params and save to 2 files net and sim.mat
- maybe functions in sim.py? can be called from params?
*** DONE - Store net and sim params in dictionaries inside params.py
eg. p.net['ncells']
- facilitates saving to file (prev point)
- can use if key in dict:

- use regexp in submlime text to replace in all files:
Find What: p\.(\w+)
Replace With: p\.sim['$1']

*** TODO - Use dict of tags/attributes for pop params and for cells
eg. p.net['popParams'][i]['cellModel']
- can use if key in dict:
*** Define conn rules based on pair of tag/value for pre and post
eg. use tuple key: connProbs['name','IT','name','IT']  = (lambda x,y: 0.1*x+0.01/y) 
or dict of dict with tuple keys: connProbs['name','IT']['name','IT']  = (lambda x,y: 0.1*x+0.01/y) 
*** DONE - Add $Id$ hg info
- can do with https://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/KeywordExtension
- but not recommended 
- bill wanted to do because cliff and I add last update and author info to files -- which is never updated correctly
- checked other github repos and they don't have it - just eg. Contributors
*** DONE - Rename main.py with init.py
*** DONE Remove popType and connType variables - infer from dict keys
*** DONE Remove popid from popParams - can use list index
*** TODO Replace topClass and subClass with projection-type, type (neurotransmitter involved?)
**** email to Ben
Hey Ben, Im working on some of the changes we discussed. I've replaced variables with dictionaries of tags/attributes. For now, I've kep the 'population' concept, although can replace in future version if makes sense. 

For both the 'population' and 'cell' objects you suggested replacing the 'topClass' and 'subClass' tags with 'projectionType' and 'cellType' if my notes are correct. I know projType for Exc cells will be 'IT', 'PT' or 'CT', but not sure what would be the best classification for Inh cells? Same thing for cellType, I think you mentioned neurotransmitters involved, but could you elaborate on what would be the list of possible values for both 'Exc' and 'Inh' cells/pops ?  

We can use the google chat or this google doc to bounce ideas back and forth (link points to new section ready to be filled in).

*** TODO Synapse
- synapses as list of objects inside each cell (postsynaptic) - netcon in pre is stub; netcon in post is real synapse
- netcon (neuron object) as part of synapse object



* 15dec28 Convert into python package
- PyNet ? NeuPyNE, NeuPyNet, netpyne !! PYthon-based NETwork development framework for the NEuron simulator
- make shared -> framework 
- from pynet import framework as f
- just need init.py and param.py file
- to add cells or conn functions use:
-- class newCellClass(PointNeuron): ... ;  f.newCellClass = newCellClass 
-- class newConnFunc(): ... ; f.newConnFunc = newConnFunc
- default simConfig
- from pynet import init ; init.createAndRun(netParams, simConfig)

* TODO
** DONE - unify cellmodel 
- cell prop conditions: 
-- cellType=RS; cellModel=HH
-- cellType=RS; cellModel=Izhi
- provide option to insert distribute mechanism or point process
- single cell class 
- then add support for 2007a - spikes+record from izh._ref_V

- INCLUDE BOTH HH AND IZHI IN SAME RULE AND USE CELLMODEL TAG IN CELL TO CHOOSE WHICH TO USE!!

** DONE - Overwrite files optional (timestamp)
** DONE - Default simConfig
** DONE - Import cells with generic set of arguments
** Use mechanismType to make importCell more robust

https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/static/new_doc/programming/mechstan.html
http://neurosimlab.org/ramcd/pyhelp/mechstan.html#MechanismStandard - 2nd example
** Add x,y positions as 'xrange' and 'yrange'
- maybe xfracRange, yfracRange
- replace yfrac with zfrac!
** Set positions in Neuron's 3D space
** importCell can modify h variables (eg. celsius)
- maybe just note in documentation that shouldnt modify h.vars - undesired effects

** LFP
- simple voltage sum 
- LFPy
** HDF5
- tried h5py (http://docs.h5py.org/en/latest/quick.html)
