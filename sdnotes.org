* 15may27 Modularized framework for NEURON/Python network simulations with MPI
** Overview
Using this modularized structure can select different cell types, populations, connectivities, etc. just by modifying the
parameters in params.py. 

An example is provided in params.py which switches from a single Hodgkin-Huxley population, randomly connected model
(mpiHHTut); to a multiple Izhikevich populations, yfrac-dependent connected M1 model.

To test this just modify the variable simType in params.py: 
simType = 'M1model' # 'mpiHHTut' 

*** Bill's description of what this repo should be
we should try to make this our main organizational code that can spin off multiple projects? -- would like a clean code center-org so that not so painful as it has been with our prior code base (which btw was all my fault and not sam's -- he inherited from me)
then any pushes back to this main center would have to be agreed by curator (you) and would generally involve just some small fix to a single file

** README with description of the different files
List of files:

- main.py: Main executable; calls functions from other modules.

- params.py: Contains all static parameters. It is imported as "p" from all other modules, so that params can be referenced from any file using p.paramName

- shared.py: Contains all the model shared variables and modules (except params.py). It is imported as "s" from all other file, so that any variable or module can be referenced from any file using s.varName

- sim.py: Simulation control functions (eg. runSim)

- network.py: Network related functions (eg. createCells)

- cell.py: contains cell and population classes 

- conn.py: contains class 'Conn' used to instantiate connections, and contains methods to connect cells (eg. random, yfrac-based)

- analysis.py: functions to plot and analyse data

- stimuli.py: functions and parameters for differnt types of neural stimulation

- izhi2007.mod: NMODL definition of Izhikevich 2007 neuron model

- evol.py: Functions to run evolutionary algorithms (using inspyred) to optimize model parameters

** Known issues, potential improvements, and alternative implementations (outdated - see TODO list at end of file)
*** TODO - Saving only happens at the end (instead of at fixed intervals)
*** TODO - Need to add a DEBUG mode or similar (like mpiHHTut had)
- currently have a verbose flag, that prints some additional info
- also have print messages along the code, which could be made optional
*** TODO - Check structure of data saved to file
- some nested lists with inhomogeneous dimensionality were converted to 'object' data types in order to be saved -- check if
  structure makes sense when reading from python/matlab
*** DONE - Some attributes/variables of the class 'Cell' and 'Pop' are not used but still initialized to [ ]
- maybe can find alternative using different constructors for different cell types
- fixed by using dictionary of tags - flexible for eahc type
*** DONE - Labels (eg. AMPA, IT, HH,...) are defined by assigning numeric values to variables
- can use dictionaries instead
- need to check pros and cons of each -- are dicts slower or have any limitations compared to lists/arrays ?
- changed to using dictionaries
*** TODO - stimuli.py not tested with this model
- left there cause thought could be useful for future
*** TODO - analysis.py still has many functions which havent been adapted to new structure
*** TODO - Some variables inherited from cliff still have too long names, eg. backgroundSpikevec
*** TODO - Lines too long, need to split using \
*** DONE - if increase p.backgroundNoise > 0.0 get memory error 
- had to store rnadom noise generator separately for each cell
*** DONE - Find a way to save lambda funcs (can't be pickled)
can use:
>>>import inspect 
>>>inspect.getsource(myfunc)
*** DONE - Clearing vector in simdata now gives error because also has python variables
for v in s.simdata.itervalues() -- fix error
separated vectors
*** TODO - 'Cell' class record method uses eval() which is unsafe
*** DONE - currently setup to record traces from all cells
*** DONE - bug when saving cell traces using multiple cores 
Gathering spikes...
>>> >>> >>> Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "main.py", line 46, in <module>
    runSeq()
  File "main.py", line 37, in runSeq
    s.sim.gatherData()
  File "sim.py", line 117, in gatherData
    for d in gather: tmp.extend(d[k]) 
KeyError: 'cellTraces_233'

- now saved using different structure 
- had to remove hoc objects that are not pickable


*** TODO - Load/save net+sim parameters from file
- load net and sim parameters file from mat?
- have different .py file to generate the params files

within params.py - have option to load from file, or set params and save to 2 files net and sim.mat
- maybe functions in sim.py? can be called from params?
*** DONE - Store net and sim params in dictionaries inside params.py
eg. p.net['ncells']
- facilitates saving to file (prev point)
- can use if key in dict:

- use regexp in submlime text to replace in all files:
Find What: p\.(\w+)
Replace With: p\.sim['$1']

*** TODO - Use dict of tags/attributes for pop params and for cells
eg. p.net['popParams'][i]['cellModel']
- can use if key in dict:
*** Define conn rules based on pair of tag/value for pre and post
eg. use tuple key: connProbs['name','IT','name','IT']  = (lambda x,y: 0.1*x+0.01/y) 
or dict of dict with tuple keys: connProbs['name','IT']['name','IT']  = (lambda x,y: 0.1*x+0.01/y) 
*** DONE - Add $Id$ hg info
- can do with https://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/KeywordExtension
- but not recommended 
- bill wanted to do because cliff and I add last update and author info to files -- which is never updated correctly
- checked other github repos and they don't have it - just eg. Contributors
*** DONE - Rename main.py with init.py
*** DONE Remove popType and connType variables - infer from dict keys
*** DONE Remove popid from popParams - can use list index
*** TODO Replace topClass and subClass with projection-type, type (neurotransmitter involved?)
**** email to Ben
Hey Ben, Im working on some of the changes we discussed. I've replaced variables with dictionaries of tags/attributes. For now, I've kep the 'population' concept, although can replace in future version if makes sense. 

For both the 'population' and 'cell' objects you suggested replacing the 'topClass' and 'subClass' tags with 'projectionType' and 'cellType' if my notes are correct. I know projType for Exc cells will be 'IT', 'PT' or 'CT', but not sure what would be the best classification for Inh cells? Same thing for cellType, I think you mentioned neurotransmitters involved, but could you elaborate on what would be the list of possible values for both 'Exc' and 'Inh' cells/pops ?  

We can use the google chat or this google doc to bounce ideas back and forth (link points to new section ready to be filled in).

*** TODO Synapse
- synapses as list of objects inside each cell (postsynaptic) - netcon in pre is stub; netcon in post is real synapse
- netcon (neuron object) as part of synapse object


* 15dec28 Convert into python package
- PyNet ? NeuPyNE, NeuPyNet, netpyne !! PYthon-based NETwork development framework for the NEuron simulator
- make shared -> framework 
- from pynet import framework as f
- just need init.py and param.py file
- to add cells or conn functions use:
-- class newCellClass(PointNeuron): ... ;  f.newCellClass = newCellClass 
-- class newConnFunc(): ... ; f.newConnFunc = newConnFunc
- default simConfig
- from pynet import init ; init.createAndRun(netParams, simConfig)

* 16jan26 Possibly making more simulator-indep using NeuroML-based format
** NeuroML format 
- could represent all nml format using python dicts (instantiated net)
- additional abstract layer (connParams, netParams etc) - using more general format and then converted to nml
- eg. https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/Thalamocortical/tree/master/neuroConstruct/generatedNeuroML2
- https://www.neuroml.org/getneuroml
- https://www.neuroml.org/tool_support
- https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/libNeuroML
- https://github.com/NeuroML/pyNeuroML
- http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/CNO
- http://www.neuroconstruct.org/
- http://neuronvisio.org/


*** Issues
- Would like to keep simple declarative (python dicts based) specifications
- Want to make netpyne more NEURON-independent, both at specifications, and py instantiated network
- netpyne makes use of mod files, but neuroml requires detailed specification
- netpyne provides conversion from abstract specifications -> instantiated network, and support for multicompartment, and
  subcellular connectivity
- netpyne provides instantiation of NEURON objects, and parallel simulation of network
- netpyne can use NeuroML structure but using dictionaries instead of xml text - so easy to manipulate
- libneuroml and pynn - procedural, not so intuitive, and require internal definition of cell types etc (eg. IAF); whereas
  netpyne is 'declarative', more intuitive?, can define arbitrary cell props based on mechs and syns
- dictionary of equivalences NEURON<->NeuroML (eg. tau1, rise)

*** cells
NOTE: segment = sections/segment; segmentGroup = sectionList/section
- can have segmentGroups that consist of segmentGroups
- Neuron sections->segmentGroups
- Neuron 3d points -> segmnets
- Neuron nseg -> property tag numberInternalDivisions
- if have pointProcess in segment -> mapping of position along section and where pointprocess is placed

** chat with Bill
summary of 3-hr meeting with Ben: 1) he really likes netpyne, 2) discussed how to add subcellular syn info (3 main methods: sectionlists, yfrac-based, path distance-based), 3) provided his unpublished code to convert sCRACM data to synapse density maps and said we can use in netpyne, 4) suggested making netpyne more NEURON/simulator-independent (similar to Kim Blackwell)

on this last point (simu-indep), I looked at NeuroML2 format, and some of the tools Padraig has built 2 interface it with Python and Neuron (eg. neuroconstruct, pyNeuroML, libNeuroML), and read Robert's reproducibility paper

I think it might be possible to make netpyne simulator-independent at the specs and instantiated network, using a NeuroML-like internal format (but using python dicts instead of xml so can manipulate data) -- and then keep final stage where its converted to Neuron simulatable objects

sent padraig an email to discuss the technical details of what they've already implemented and how netpyne could fit, and be useful to fill in missing tools in this whole story

an alternative is to keep it as a tool specific for Neuron, with its internal Neuron-based format for specs and network, and the possibility of exporting/importing from NeuroML and others (ie. its current status)

** chat with Padraig
- good to separate M1 model from netpyne
- similarities with pnn and libneuroml
- important of neuroml is conceptual structure
- libneuroml has cell types
- mapping from pyneuroml to mod files, but not the other way around

- standardization of abstract conn rules is above pynn and nueroml/pyneuroml
- eg 10 conn algorithms -> pynn -> neuroml
- morphology - segments, segment groups

- mod files would need to be translated into nueroml (not fully translated); alternative would be point to nueroml
  definition, convert via pyneuroml to Neuron mod
- setup.py to netpyne
- dot.travis.yml continuous integration server - run tests every time there is a commit to repository - make sure its consistent
  with latest version

- convert from Neuron model to NeuroML:
-- export specifications 
-- OSB converting to NeuroML2 cell morphology (pyneuroml.convert_to_neuroml2) - in future if already in neuroml dont need to
 define in Nueron/netpyne format 
-- Izhikevich (params) - abstract definiton
-- export to Nueroml2 positions and connectivity - no current tool to convert
-- https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/Cerebellum3DDemo
-- http://www.opensourcebrain.org/docs#Converting_To_NeuroML2


- convert from NeuromML to Neuron:
-- java script to convert neuroml to mod and Neuron/py files - wait for better iteration
-- adapt java code to convert directly to netpyne
-- https://github.com/NeuroML/org.neuroml.export/blob/development/src/main/java/org/neuroml/export/neuron/NeuronWriter.java
-- https://github.com/NeuroML/org.neuroml.export/blob/development/src/main/java/org/neuroml/export/pynn/PyNNWriter.java
-- check param files hhtut izhitut updated so can padraig can modify
-- add load cell function in netpyne in neuroml format


- differences:
1) declarative
2) netpyne makes use of mod files, but neuroml requires detailed specification
3) netpyne provides conversion from abstract specifications -> instantiated network, and support for multicompartment, and
  subcellular connectivity
4) netpyne provides instantiation of NEURON objects, and parallel simulation of network

- options:
-- long-term: use Neuroml internally for instantiated network 
-- short-term:  Neuron-based and conversion to NeuroML; 

* 16jan27 Consolidate connectivity functions
** Full conn -> fullConn
- =probConn with prob = 1?
** combine convConn, divConn, and randConn?
- probFunc = optional param -- if not present, then:
- select function depending of param included? eg. 'convergence', 'divergence', 'probability'
** Random conn with N conns per postsyn cell (convergence) -> convConn
~= conv conn
- conv param allowed as function eg. uniform, gauss
- also allows for weight+delay as func
** Random conn with N conns per presyn cell (divergence) -> divConn
** Random conn with fixed, function (including distance-dep) prob, weight, delay -> probConn
*** fixed
number eg. 5
*** func
- uniform
*** func dist-dep
- function of yfrac
- function of 3d distance
- generalizable to func of 
-- (pre, post, dist) + '_' + (xfrac, yfrac, zfrac, x, y, z) = 18 variables
-- (dist) + '_' + (xznorm, xyznorm, xz, xyz) = 4 variables
-- total: 22 variables
- create dictionary with each variable associated to its value/variable/function -- don't evaluate to save
- enter as string, and convert to function
- other variables allowed: any that are defined in f.net.params[var] -- arbitrary
** implementation
- use **kwargs
- string based - converted to function, extract variables
- arguments weight and delay valid for all conn types; and can be functional

Options to implement func:
*** lambda with kwargs - NO
prob = lambda(**d): d['pre_ynorm']*0.5
*** lambda with args - NO!
prob = lambda(*d): d[3]*0.5
*** string
prob = 'pre_ynorm*0.5'
prob = 'post_xyznorm*0.5
prob = 'uniform()'
prob = 'gauss(10,5)'
prob = 'uniform(1,5)'
- functions allow all of python random functions 
- internal implementation:
-- identifiy variables (pre, post or dist x,y,z,2d or 3d; plus any arbitrary defined in netParams)
-- define dict mapping variable name to lambda function returning actual variable using preCell and postCell as args
-- convert string to lambda function with variables as arguments
-- call lambda function with args as dict with each entry mapped to lambda func that returns the variable
*** efficiency
- calculate all delay, prob, weight funcs together at the beginning
- calcualte weights+delays for all possible conns despite some will not be used?
- alternative might be more comput costly (calling 1 by 1), and repeated code
- use map(lambda, list)
- calculate final list of weights,probs,delays and pass to specific conn func

*** errors
- arguments by reference using lambda func only works for 'delay' if 'convergence' func loops over preCellsTags and postCells
  -- even though they have nothing to do with each other!! whats going on? python bug? Im missing something?!

** how to update at intervals
*** why needed?
- periodic saves (eg. of weights)
- update virtual arm apparatus
- run RL on syns based on critic signal
- calculate LFP

*** option 1: run sim for short periods of time (not efficient?)
while round(h.t) < s.duration:
        s.pc.psolve(min(s.duration,h.t+s.loopstep)
*** option 2: finitialize handler?
** netpyne format
- within conn rule

- One set of STDP params for each conn rule:
STDPparams = {'hebbwt': , 'antiwt':, 'wmax':, 'RLon': , 'RLhebbwt', 'RLantiwt', 'tauhebb', 'RLwindhebb', 'useRLexp', 'softthresh'

STDP + RL weight adjuster mechanism

Original STDP code adapted from:
http://senselab.med.yale.edu/modeldb/showmodel.asp?model=64261&file=\bfstdp\stdwa_songabbott.mod

Adapted to implement a "nearest-neighbor spike-interaction" model (see 
Scholarpedia article on STDP) that just looks at the last-seen pre- and 
post-synaptic spikes, and implementing a reinforcement learning algorithm based
on (Chadderdon et al., 2012):
http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0047251

Example Python usage:

from neuron import h

## Create cells
dummy = h.Section() # Create a dummy section to put the point processes in
ncells = 2
cells = []
for c in range(ncells): cells.append(h.IntFire4(0,sec=dummy)) # Create the cells

## Create synapses
threshold = 10 # Set voltage threshold
delay = 1 # Set connection delay
singlesyn = h.NetCon(cells[0],cells[1], threshold, delay, 0.5) # Create a connection between the cells
stdpmech = h.STDP(0,sec=dummy) # Create the STDP mechanism
presyn = h.NetCon(cells[0],stdpmech, threshold, delay, 1) # Feed presynaptic spikes to the STDP mechanism -- must have weight >0
pstsyn = h.NetCon(cells[1],stdpmech, threshold, delay, -1) # Feed postsynaptic spikes to the STDP mechanism -- must have weight <0
h.setpointer(singlesyn._ref_weight[0],'synweight',stdpmech) # Point the STDP mechanism to the connection weight

*** netpynesimplestdp.mod
- if use stdp.m1ms:
-- only hebb events at the beginning
-- RL not working cause tlasthebbelig doesn't update 

- if use stdp.cliff:
-- both stdp and RL happen - but correctly??
-- only hebb - so maybe anti-hebb not working
-- if critic = -1 

- problem might be netpyne?

*** m1ms model
- if use stdp.cliff:
-- seems like too many hebb events?
-- RL works (with critic =1 or -1) - but might be wrong due to hebb events?

- if use stdp.m1ms:
-- Hebbian works (no anti-Hebbian?)
-- RL works (with critic =1 or -1)


*** found bug and fixed (skip instead of w)
- use separate 'skip' variable to skip the 2nd set of conditions; instead of using the 'w' var, since otherwise 'w' gets
  fixed to that value for following events

*** need to fix so -1 critic RL also works - fixed
- was due to soft threshold being on -- reduces -1 effect if close to min weight; and reduces +1 effect if close to max
  weight

*** check antihebb learning
- fixed bug: if  ((tlastpost > -1) && (-interval > 1.0))  (interval had to be -1)

* 16mar04 Adding subcellular synaptic conn distribution
** sectionList
- need during runtim? for connectivity purposes?
- option 1: can include section attribute named 'sectionList' and add name, but could take longer to set properties if have to search all
- option 2: can include as dict in sectionLists in cellProp, and then add all sections inside of each sectionList dict; but would
  change the consistency of the generic implementation (cell.py etc)
- option 3: can add additional dict sectionLitst in cellProp, simply including list of sections (need to return additional
  dic from util.py function)
- best options seem 1 or 3
- Need to create sectionList at runtime? useful?

cellRule = {'label': 'PYRrule', 'conditions': {'cellType': 'PYR'},  'secs': {}, 'secLists': {}} 
...
cellRule['secLists']['all'] = ['soma', 'dend']

- Can't define properties of section lists in netpyne
- Neuron section list object not created - just python version
- Can import cell with sectionlists
- Can use sectionlists in connectivity

- Modified importCell so it reads sectionLists with original variable names; and modified input arguments so now pass
  cellRule as 1st arg -- so can add 'secs' and 'secLists' to cellRule dict

** Discussion with Ben
- define subcellular location of synapses:
1) named sectionlists of sublists - apicatuft, obliques
2) radial distribution, fraction yfrac, normalized, cortical depth, where dendrites fall in layers (cx centered, not cell
 centered)
3) path distance from soma 
-- plus combination of above
-- 1st, 2nd order branches differences cannot be specified directly, but can create sectionlists 
eg. 1st 50um apical trunk no spines - subsets that are spiny vs non-spiny

2 METHODS:
A) 2-step implementation: 1) unitary conns, 2) contacts (subcellular conn)
B) axo-dendritic density overlap - you don't know unitary without calculating subcellular
-- HBP approach - axonal density is function of proj from L2->L5 + dendritic density, even if cells not realistic, calculate
weight+prob

if we imagine a hierarch struc where a 'unitaryConn' object contains a list of 'contacts' (~= Neuron Netcons) and 'synapses' (Neuron Synapses)
this unitaryConn would have a specific pre and post-cell id
but it may be the case, that the synapse is used as the target of many presyn cells
(at least in Neuron terms and how we usually build models now)
which means the 'synapse' would have to be outside of the 'unitaryConn' and just be referenced by name or whatever
I'll just point out that this doesn't make all that much sense to me (despite being the way you do it)

- 2 levels of instantiation - abstract (no specific models, not simulatable, cellular); and specific (subcellular)
- from 1st - every neuron has to be assigned and implementation; and every connection has to be implemented
- thats what happens right now but abstract instantiation is not saved
- 2nd step consists of instantiating subcellular info - cell morphology + subcellular conn (could be separate)
- 1st pass) cellular instatiation step (includes cell+conns); 2nd pass) subcellular step; 3rd pass) choose simulator pick
  Neuron object for each cell
- In 3rd level decide where to place h.Netcons and h.Synapses 

- conns = unitary conns - presyn, type (AMPA), weight (somatic response for 1 AP presyn cell ~0.2 mV EPSP), delay?
- in connParams have subcellular conn info - but not added to cell objects, only once create simulatable individual cells,
  wire it up 

- just 3 levels : specifications -> cellular -> simulator instantiation
- Neurons instantiation separate from python structure - linked by cell id
- for each unitary connection, check cell model of presyn and postsyn and decide if use NetCons, Synapses etc 

** Current implementation
- Cell (object)
-- conns (list of dicts)
--- hNetcon
--- preGid
--- weight
--- threshold
--- sec
--- syn

-- secs (dict of dicts)
--- geom
--- topol
--- mechs
--- pointps
--- syns (dict)
---- hSyn
---- _loc
---- _type
---- tau
---- e

** Pros/Cons of making conns indep of cells 
- pros:
-- easier to search for conns, do analysis etc
-- conceptually make more sense (Ben, Bill)
-- consistent with NueroML

- cons:
-- synapses separate from cell too? associate via gid? prev models and Neuron standard is syns inside cell, conns outside; harder to check syns 
-- make sure conns for each cell in same node -- seems easy since will happen naturally
-- easier to find conns of a given cell


** Possible structure (with contacts inside each unitary conn):
- net (object of class Network)
-- cells (list of objects of class Cell)
-- conns (list of dicts)
--- preGid
--- postGid
--- contacts (list of dicts)
---- hNetcon
---- weight
---- threshold
---- sec
---- syn

- Advantage is that would have equivalent top level connections indepdently of subcellular info (morphology).
- Advantage: Need to know all unitary connections before can actually implement the subcellular details - distribution
  depends on total number of input conns

- Disadvantage is that have more complex hierarchical structure, more difficult to search, if have simple single contacts
  then overcomplicated, and doesnt match neuroml 

** Alternative structure (with single list of contacts):
- net (object of class Network)
-- cells (list of objects of class Cell)
-- conns (list of dicts)
--- preGid
--- postGid
--- hNetcon
--- weight
--- threshold
--- sec
--- syn

for unitary conns - find unique preGid/postGid (eg. print list(set(zip(*myList)[1])))

** Alternative structure (with contacts inside, but as a class)
- net (object of class Network)
-- cells (list of objects of class Cell)
-- conns (list of object of class Connection)
--- preGid
--- postGid
--- contacts (list of dicts)
---- hNetcon
---- weight
---- threshold
---- sec
---- syn

Advantage - can have subcelullar methods inside

** Structure with proper nomenclature for cellConns, synConns, synMechs 
- net (object of class Network)
-- cells (list of objects of class Cell)
-- cellConns (list of object of class CellConnection)
--- preGid
--- postGid
--- synConns (list of dicts)
---- hNetcon
---- weight
---- threshold
---- sec
---- synMech

** Choice of cellConns, synConns, synMechs 

- 'cellConns' = unitary connection between 2 cells (can contain many synapses) = non-existent (Neuron) = non-existent (NeuroML)
= 'connection' (HBP)

- 'synConns': individual synaptic contacts made between single pre and post cell (each connection can contain many) =
  'h.NetCon' (Neuron) = 'connections' (NeuroML) = 'synapse' (HBP)

- 'synMechs': postsynaptic mechanism (receptor-like), usually one per connection = eg. 'h.ExpSyn' or 'h.AMPA' (Neuron) =
  eg. 'alphaSynapse' (NeuroML) = 'synaptic mechanism' (HBP)

** neuroml conn structure
- projections: between populations; pre, post and synapse
- connection: pregid, postgid, presegment, postsegment, prefraction, postfraction

** netpyne implementation
- check number of presyn cells connecting to post (cellCons)
- check syn distribution pattern and morphology of post
- need to calculate num of synConns based on weight?? or fixed weight for synConn (divide cellConn weight by num of synConns?)
- create synConns and synMechs 

- Is it worth having CellConn as class with SynConn attribute and methods? 
-- only 5 syns/cell
-- need to know all cellconns before start synconns, but method cannot be inside cellconn cause need to check all cellconns
-- have to call method createSubCellConn if params includes subCell - do once for each conn rule (from network.py)
-- subcellular syn dist shouldn't be replicated on each CellConn, just once on conn rule

- createConns
-- for each rule:
--- probConn/convConn
---- cellConns.append(CellConn) (but no subcellular)
-- for all cellConns:
---  cellConns.addSubcellular 

- but needs subcell params from rule!! so either 
-- need to be stored in each cellConn / pointer to f.net.params -- shouldn't occupy extra space since pointer (can remove
after so not saved?)

- do we need subcellular info for each conn rule?! or just for each cell type and synMech?! Ben mentioned 'after logic conns,
  create subcellular based on presyn+postsyn cell type"

- weight + delay a property of CellConn or SynConn ?! both?

- how to create extra synMechs needed? identical properties to cellprop syn mechs?

- maybe there's no need for cellconns vs synconns? 
-- if subcellular info: create temporal cellconns, then synconns (from synconns can generate cellconns after)
-- if no subcellular info: create synconns directly

- or create cellconns and synconns as independent lists (redundant)

- maybe create separate rules for subcellular distribution; needed because:
-- conn data as func of yfrac (eg. [0.1 - 0.2])
-- syn dist for presyn layer/type (eg. L2/3)
-- wouldn't make sense to repeat for each yfrac-based conn rule (or cell type rule), plus need all 

- maybe add subcellular distribution to cell prop rules:
-- for each cell prop, create conditions of subcellular distribution eg. ['conditions': {'yfrac': [0.1-0.4]}]
-- default: assume uniform distribution

- where to put properties of synapses?
-- can add to sections in properties 
-- can just add generic, by setting '_loc': 'generic' ? -- but still inside a section! :/
-- just make algorithm look for synmechs in all sections, and use same params to replicate
-- maybe move 'synMechs' out, to same level as 'secs' ? 
-- add to sectionList !?

** sCRACM (Petreanu 2009; Suter,2015)
- inject ChR2 in certain presyn axons (eg. L2/3)
- short pohotostimulation 1ms 2mW in specific grid (12x24, 50um) location
- depolarizes axons; use TTX (blocked Na+ and K+ ->no AP)
- axon terminal Ca2+ channels open -> glutamate release
- measure EPSC in soma

- provides a two-dimensional ‘image’ of the distribution of specific input within the dendritic arbors of the recorded cell

- EPSCsCRACM amplitudes depend on the density of ChR2-positive axons, the fraction of axons that make synapses with the
  recorded neuron, the strength of the synapses, and their electrotonic distance from the soma

- sCRACM maps were normalized to the largest pixels within a map and thus represent the relative strength of input within the dendritic tree.

- Average sCRACM map of layer 2/3 inputs to M1-CSPs (n = 23 neurons). L, Input profiles by soma depth. M, Location of perisomatic input from layer 2/3 relative to soma position, plotted as a function of soma depth. For each profile, the input depth was calculated as the center of mass across the perisomatic pixels.

** questions for ben
*** always have to specify num contacts or distribution?
-- Yes, or distribution
-- Ben: if full model the could calculate exactly; but since scaled down, we want syns per conn to be correct eg. 5
-- assume in M1 model, realistic density, but reduced volume -- experiments found ~5 for PT->PT not in motor cx
-- likely that there is data 
-- does it vary significantly? Thalamocortical could be very different; assume every proj has 4-6 contacts as measured
-- select a fixed value eg 5. and value strength/weight of each synConn


*** Weight+delay in cellConn or synConn or both?
-- if data from unitary conn EPSP, the cellConn, but need to calculate weight/synConn (h.NetCon)
-- allow weights both at cellConn and synConn level
-- if weight * 2 makes the synapse twice as strong?
-- can know max conductance, and temp response
-- Lefort used EPSP mV in soma for cellConn -- need to know how to calculate synConn -- is there a way to do this
 analytically?
-- he did in scracm code- assume syn density is correct, electrotonic difference made different between measured and simualated -- multiply by factor difference, resimulate and compare again
-- syns close to soma were fine; syns far away, original map had understimated response of far away syns, and rescaled far
 away syns
-- pattern of syn density for cell -- function of yfrac -- only need to calculate for original scracm map, and output should
 be rule
-- but for cellConn -> 5 synConns get 1mV in soma when activated simultaneously -- but will be distributed along dendrites so
 different transmission delays -- difficult to calculate accurately
-- most models dont distribute syns over dendrite with realistic syn density

-- delay could be identical for each synConn, or add small distance-based delay
-- delay would vary due to extra distance traveled through unmyelinated axon (1 m/s) -- 1.1ms diff for different pyramidal
 neurons - can omit for now - euclidean distance between cell bodies - condVelocity = 1m/s
-- minDelay value = 2ms -- too high! set to maybe 0.5 ms or 1ms -- max(0.5, 3d distance based) ; for closeby cells, axon goes
 down ~100um (fat axon), collaterals branch off, come back up 100 or 200um ; localDelay = 0.5ms
-- for long-range conns use longer delays - eg. 4 ms - kind of aritraty seems noise 

- Bill: have to normalize by position based on a transfer function between locations and soma
-- can use someting like ted's multifreq transfer func program to get tha map
-- yes have to scale baesd on loc and based on freq of input -- eg a high freq (short) input like AMPA has less effect on soma than a slow eg NMDA
-- was looking at paper on that recently but is just for passive case

a 'frequency tool'
-- also depends on the Rm and on active conductances, 
eg an EPSP can end up being terminated by K chans or can be primarily and active response so that the actual gsyn is only a small piece

*** Syn dist specific to postsyn mech? depends on presyn cell props,loc?
-- Specific to eg. AMPA/NMDA, or just exc vs inh?
-- we dont have specific data on differnt receptors -- assume all exc are both AMPA and NMDA, and have a conductance ratio
 between them - has been measured (maybe ratio different in tuft vs basal, but ignore for now); allow to customize ratio
- depends on presyn cell type and layer (eg. L2/3 exc vs L5B IT vs L5B PT)
-- M1 L2/3 -> SPI sCRACM map
-- Petreanu barrel cortex L2/3 or L4 -> yfrac sCRACM map
-- long range inputs sCRACM maps (both Ben and Petreanu)


*** Why need to know num of conns before start? Can have prob dist of synapse, and map on a cell-by-cell basis, adapt
  probabilities based on current num contacts
-- wouldn't be exact since probability based; but need final distribution to match ratios


*** The non-uniform mapped / distance from soma-based would be given in the form of 30x10 map, distribution across segments?
-- exp data is in 30x10 map format; distr across segments would vary depending on cell morphology
-- netpyne should be a 30x10 length density
-- num of syns/um 
-- within given pixel stimulated with blue light, pixel = 50x50 um, num of syns/um/dendrite - homogeneous within 50x50um 
-- convert scracm map -> map of how many syns per length of dendrite at each region of the map (at each pixel)
-- need to know how much dendrite in that pixel, and how many sysn were coactivated to get soma response
-- his method: put fixed number of [of syns in] dendrite, and then adjusted weight of these syns
-- couldnt really separate weights from num of synapses -- started with plausible weight and num of syns 
-- length density for a specific assumption of conductances (used to convert map)
-- input to netpyne should be free from Neuron peculiarities -- relates to somehting experimentally -- num of syn per length
 of dendrite and strength of each of thsoe syns as a peak conductance
- 2 types of map: 1) num syns/um of dendrite, 2) conductance of syns/um dendrite (probably uniform everywhere) 
- remain within bounds that exp plausible - eg. now num of spines in a dend tree (eg max 20k)
- L5->L5 somatic epsp unitary conns 0.2 0.5 mv for 5 syns/conn --> each syn has g that will result in 0.1 mV epsp soma
-- but will depend on location eg apical tuft won't give you value
-- 5 number comes mostly from counting dyns in basal -- but maybe also in apical tuft but weren't undetected (90% came from
 basals)
-- so probably ok to assume most syns are in basal not apical tuft
-- in his model he calculated conduc value for standard synapse that gives 0.1 or 0.2 mV (assume uniform over all arbor), so
 need to vary num of contacts and location

*** Other formats apart from length density map and conductance map (50um and 10x30 map,aligned to pia, centerd on soma):
-- for STR assume they get same input and infer similar density map for STR cells -- convert using dendritic density of STR
cells
-- simpler way: syn length density maps are also radial functions -- if account for how much dendrite there is, the x
dimension of map may not contain any info -- so rule is based on 1d map (radial function) - 30x1 map - function of yfrac (in
50 um bins)
-- could be averaged or represent individual neurons -- for scracm map doesnt make sense to average 
-- sectionLists - scracm has 50um resoulution but actually more like 100um resoulution -- if you look at dends, 1st 50um of
apical trunk have no syns; 1st 20um of root basal dont have any syns (just few) -- at a scale where scracm doesnt reach there
might be no syns
-- so where scracm doesnt reach can use sectionList to complement and tell u there are no syns thre -- eg. spiny sectionList
contains all sections except where they were no spines/syns - so set density to 0 
-- in neuron if u didnt reconstruct eveyr spine, you account for that by increasing cm -- in detailed model I'm using --
compensated by increasing membrane area 
- syn density maps are not common - so need other way to specify for rest -- more common data in literature,
  anatomical/categorical statements eg. this interneuron targets apical tuft -- but no specific numeric values (details not
  known) -- usually always anatomical 
- he can send SPI syn length density map -- SEND EMAIL!



** comments by ben
If you want to see which dendrites are on basal, apical, etc. then better to look at the profiles sorted by soma depth, i.e. where you can see each individual neuron's input collapsed to a radial profile.

[5:17] 
Or a soma-aligned average map.

[5:18] 
The former is in my paper. The latter I have as figs.

[5:19] 
In my paper I also show analysis of where the "perisomatic" input is centered, relative to the soma - generally above the soma with an offset of ~50 um, but depends on projection and on soma depth.

[5:19] 
One consistent finding was that while the basals do get input from all sources, it's a bit weaker below the soma (note that there are basals above the soma too).

[5:21] 
The sCRACM technique probably won't work well for local L5->L5 connections (Taro tried this with Rabies - not mapping, but
LED flash - and said the input was too weak). But for L5-L5 connections we can turn to pair recording studies with full
reconstructions of dendrites and axons - such as published by Markram et al 1997 (methinks), with Sakmann.

There is substantial variability within each projection - seen clearly in the example Salva just pasted. Some CSP get strong L2/3 input, while others don't - even if their soma depth is similar.

[5:29] 
So my thought was to take each actual map and apply the inferred synapse density onto reconstructions at approximately matched soma depths. Do this for each projection.

[5:29] 
For the L2/3 -> CSP data set, I have reconstructions and maps in the same neuron, for a subset of the data set. For the other projections, I don't have reconstructions.

[5:30] 
So the idea would be to take each mapped neuron, use it's soma depth to find the reconstruction with closest matching soma depth, and instantiate that.

[5:31] 
Or alternatively (and probably better), take each reconstructed neuron, and then apply synapses to it according to every projection - where for each projection, you find the map whose soma depth best matches the reconstructed neuron.

[5:32] 
Another approach I started working on is to parameterize each projection's pattern as a function of soma depth, so that there is a formula M_i(somadepth) for each projection i, which lets you determine the synapse distribution for neuron's at any depth.

[5:34] 
However, because the sCRACM maps don't tell you synapse density (but rather, synaptic strength measured at soma under strange pharmacological conditions), before you can calculate a formula for the whole projection, you'd need to simulate each map to infer the synapse density. Unless ... it turns out that there is a nice analytic way to convert the input maps into synapse densities, i.e. without simulating each one. From the few simulations I've done, this might actually be possible.


** Features implemented with adhoc solution -- need to be fixed
*** GENERAL
*** default synMech placed in soma - where to define? make syns separate like neuroml
- don't create synMechs until needed by connections -- just specify params? but need to store somewhere
- can look up in f.net.params using tags['propList'] but probably slow

- in Cell class have pointer to f.net.params from synMechs but dont create new python/neuron object
- place synapse together with connection instead of cell? confusing since many conns can project to single synapse

-  In neuroml, syns are defined independently, and associated with connections - do same thing:

netParams['synMechParams'] = {'NMDA': {'mod': 'ExpSyn', 'tau': 0.1, 'e': 0}}
cell.secs['soma']['synMechs'][0]['label': 'NMDA', 'loc': 0.5, 'hSyn': ]

- place synMechs outside of sec? might be slower to find; plus synMechs are pointps so 'belong' to section

- no need to add in netParams, specified in connRule, and created together with connections
- when create conn check if synMech exists in that section, ie. has same 'label' and 'loc', if not, then create

- make addSyn function

- comparison of searching inside list vs accessing dict (~20x faster, for 1M conns: 0.75 sec vs 0.03sec; for 100M conns: 75
  sec vs 4 sec):
-- but have to add time of searching for specific location too

timeit.timeit("b=next((item for item in a if item['label']=='ampa'), None)", setup="a=[{'label':'gabab','v':10},{'label':'gaba','v':10},{'label':'nmda','v':10},{'label':'ampa','v':10}]", number=1000000)

- NEED TO IMPORT SYNAPSES INTO SYNMECHPARAMS

*** independent scale conn weight for each cell model 
- where to store?
- useful feature
- maybe by default should be stored by cell model
- allow both options (same variable)
*** move conns and stims out of Cell class
- make stims be normal populations?
- stims from S2 projection could make 2000 syns into single cell!
- maybe place netstim part of stim outside of cell, but keep netcon inside
- maybe keep conns inside cell for now? seems to make things easier eg. have all synConns of that cell ready to distribute


*** CONN RULE
*** conn rule with list of synMechs
- eg. [AMPA, NMDA]
- weightFraction or weightRatio - eg. 
- synWeightFraction = [0.9, 0.1]
*** synsPerConn as distribution
- allows functional - seems to be gauss around 5 (E->) or 1 (I->)

*** weight/delay of conn and syns
- allow to provide single weight -- find way to estimate weight of syn contacts -- check 16mar24 entry with papers to read!
- allow to provide list of synweights -- one per synConn (eg. 5 values) by convention assign starting from pia
- allow functional only for single value (otherwise code would get overcomplicated)
- maybe allow argument that represents location of synapse (not of cell) ??

*** SUBCELL RULE
*** create 1st conns, then syns 
- 2 steps, so can distribute syns 
- create temporary cellConns or keep?
- need somewhere to store unitary weight? or when convert to subcellular lose?
- 1) create synConns but don't assign locs/delays/weights; 2) for each cell distribute syns, based on sep subcellular rules
-- maybe add subcellular distribution to cell prop rules:
--- for each cell prop, create conditions of subcellular distribution eg. ['conditions': {'yfrac': [0.1-0.4]}]
--- default: assume uniform distribution
--- wouldn't make sense to repeat for each yfrac-based conn rule, plus need all 

- create num synConns in 1st pass, and then replace if needed based on subcelluar rules

- only do 2nd pass if any subcellular rules (can't depend of numSyns cause could be 1, but still need to distribute)
*** distribute syns in sectionList or list of sectionLists
- add suport for list of sectionLists - or even combination?!
*** syn distribution specification
- 2d syn density map
- 1d syn density map (yfrac)
- apply 1d or 2d map only to certain sectionList, eg. spiny
- categorical data - eg. by sectionLists + distribution function (uniform, gauss)


** Meeting with Ben (March 18)
*** Comments from Ben
- conceptual framework makes sense
- HBP approach - axodendritic approach vs. know unitary and subcellular = refinement
- 2 netcons to same synapse - what happens if input at same timestep ? coincident spiking
- 1st pass + 2nd pass - approves
- network model indep of subcellular info
- single synapse could represent a projection between 
- unitary conn from preCell A could project to postCell B and C (so not totally accurate in terms of anatomy)
- Do we need subcellular map for each presyn and postyn cell type, or per conn rule
-- only pero conn rule if you average maps; but could also use indiv cell maps for each cell model
-- upper and deeper SPI cells scracm maps suggests they would have different input-output relations in networks 
-- for a given  density map could end with different syn density (and input-output relation) by applying to diff morphologies 
-- yfrac dep of subcellular conn 
-- also variabilty 
-- CSP morphology very consistent for diff cortical depths; difference is in linker segments (eg 8% vs 12%) so not big diff
-- CSTR differences based on yfrac - within L5A and L5B - dont know if intrinsic diffs in CSTR

- Make 3 CSP models - upper, middle, lower - 100 um apart -- get data from 10 cells for each and fit -- then test if can
  replace each of them and still get consistent results or very different (1 membrane model into 3 diff morphologies)

- For IT have upper layer, L5A, L5B, and L6 -- CSTR give you L5A, L5B, and have data for IT upper layers

- IT cells - corticortical (corticocollosal; not exclusive) in L2/3; corticostriatal mostly in L5 (also corticocortical; not
  exclusive); not all 1 class (eg. project to S2 and M1, non-overlapping, intrinsics are different) 
- Naoki looked at IT L/3, L4 and L5 -- different intrinsic? no consistent answer

- cellConns vs synConns needed? 
-- single S2 prjection can make 2000-3000 synapses /contacts into single cell

** Estimating synConn weights from cellConn weight
*** Discussion with Ben+Bill
**** Weight+delay in cellConn or synConn or both? (Ben)
-- if data from unitary conn EPSP, the cellConn, but need to calculate weight/synConn (h.NetCon)
-- allow weights both at cellConn and synConn level
-- if weight * 2 makes the synapse twice as strong?
-- can know max conductance, and temp response
-- Lefort used EPSP mV in soma for cellConn -- need to know how to calculate synConn -- is there a way to do this
 analytically?
-- he did in scracm code- assume syn density is correct, electrotonic difference made different between measured and simualated -- multiply by factor difference, resimulate and compare again
-- syns close to soma were fine; syns far away, original map had understimated response of far away syns, and rescaled far
 away syns
-- pattern of syn density for cell -- function of yfrac -- only need to calculate for original scracm map, and output should
 be rule
-- but for cellConn -> 5 synConns get 1mV in soma when activated simultaneously -- but will be distributed along dendrites so
 different transmission delays -- difficult to calculate accurately
-- most models dont distribute syns over dendrite with realistic syn density

-- delay could be identical for each synConn, or add small distance-based delay
-- delay would vary due to extra distance traveled through unmyelinated axon (1 m/s) -- 1.1ms diff for different pyramidal
 neurons - can omit for now - euclidean distance between cell bodies - condVelocity = 1m/s
-- minDelay value = 2ms -- too high! set to maybe 0.5 ms or 1ms -- max(0.5, 3d distance based) ; for closeby cells, axon goes
 down ~100um (fat axon), collaterals branch off, come back up 100 or 200um ; localDelay = 0.5ms
-- for long-range conns use longer delays - eg. 4 ms - kind of aritraty seems noise 

**** Bill
- Bill: have to normalize by position based on a transfer function between locations and soma
-- can use someting like ted's multifreq transfer func program to get tha map
-- yes have to scale baesd on loc and based on freq of input -- eg a high freq (short) input like AMPA has less effect on soma than a slow eg NMDA

**** Mark15
-Pathway specific values for the parameter “utilization of synaptic efficacy” (U, analogous to the probability of
neurotransmitter release) were unified from various experimental studies of synaptic transmission in juvenile rat
somatosensory cortex (Le Bé et al., 2007; Brémaud et al., 2007; Feldmeyer, 2006; Koester and Johnston, 2005; Markram et al.,
1997; Silver et al., 2003).

- The axonal conduction delay for each synaptic contact was computed using the axonal path distance from the soma, and a AP
  conduction velocity of 300 μm/ms, based on experimental estimates (Stuart et al., 1997). Furthermore, experimentally
  measured ratios of NMDA and AMPA conductances were used in order to model their relative contribution to unitary the EPSC
  (Feldmeyer, 2006; Myme et al., 2003; Rinaldi et al., 2007; Silver et al., 2003; Wang and Gao, 2009).

- what is 
> the significance of this Z transfer for neural communication? 

Very simple. Transfer impedance is the best predictor of the 
effect of synaptic location on synaptic efficacy. This is 
a consequence of these two facts: 
1. Peak depolarization at the synaptic trigger zone is the 
primary determinant of whether or not an epsp will trigger 
a spike. This is easily shown by computational modeling. 
2. Most synapses act like current sources, not voltage sources. 
Also easily shown by computational modeling. 

Therefore, despite everything you might find in textbooks, hear 
in the classroom, or read in most journal articles, voltage 
attenuation is not a useful predictor of the effect of synaptic 
location on synaptic efficacy. The best predictor is transfer 
impedance, which tells you how strongly a current, injected at 
one point in the cell, will affect membrane potential throughout 
the cell. See 
Jaffe, D.B. and Carnevale, N.T. Passive normalization of 
synaptic integration influenced by dendritic architecture. 
Journal of Neurophysiology 82:3268-3285, 1999. 

So if you want to understand how the distribution of synaptic 
inputs over the surface of a cell will affect the spiking 
output of that cell, study the spatial variation of 
transfer impedance from a reference point located at the 
cell's spike trigger zone (since transfer impedance between 
any two points is independent of the direction of signal 
propagation, the transfer impedance from any point to the 
soma is the same as from the soma to that point).

No room for anyone to have a global map.
​
Solution: A rendezvous rank function:
rank = rendezvous(property)
usually
rank = gid % nhost
1) Everyone sends the keys they own to the rendezvous rank.
2) Everyone sends the keys they want to the rendezvous rank.
3) The rendezvous rank sends back to the owners,
which ranks want which keys.
4) The owners send the objects to the ranks that want them.
​
 Usually simplification is possible:
If the objects are small.
1) Everyone sends the keys and objects
they own to the rendezvous rank.
2) Everyone sends the keys they want to the rendezvous rank.
3) The rendezvous rank sends the objects to the ranks that
want them.
​
 Usually simplification is possible:
If rendezvous(property) is known to be the source rank for
all the keys (a priori or by verifying with an all_reduce).
1) Everyone sends the keys they want to the owner ranks.
2) The owners send the objects to the ranks that want them.
​
 Usually simplification is possible:
If rendezvous(property) is known to be the destination rank
for all the keys (a priori or by verifying with an all_reduce).
1) The owners send the objects to the ranks that want them.

Parallel Random Numbers: As Easy as 1, 2, 3
Salmon et al. SC11 (2011)
D. E. Shaw Research, New York, NY 10036, USA
We introduce several counter based PRNGs: some based on
cryptographic standards (AES, Threefish) and some completely
new (Philox). All our PRNGs pass rigorous statistical tests
(including TestU01 s BigCrush) and produce at least 2^64
unique parallel streams of random numbers, each with period
2^128 or more.

Hi Salvador,
 
Thank you very much for talking to us today.  That was helpful.
 
As a next step for us, I wonder if I could ask you to give a quick tutorial to a larger group of folks here at the Allen Institute.  We have a meeting with several more people planned for Wednesday, July 20, at 3 pm Pacific time.  Would you be able to talk to us then?
 
I am thinking that perhaps you could speak for 20 minutes or so, and then do 10 minutes of Q&A.
 
It would be most helpful if for this tutorial you could walk us through a specific example of NetPyNE workflow applied to a question that’s of interest to us.  It doesn’t have to be a fully finished example – could be pseudo-code in part.  We would just really benefit from seeing how you are doing these operations.
 
Here’s the example I have in mind.
1. Let’s say you have 5 or so neuron types, each represented by a particular cell model and a morphology.  Let’s build a model consisting of 10,000 neurons that are replicas of these 5 models.
 
2. Distribute the 10,000 cells in space.
 
3. Connect the neurons using cell-type specific connectivity rules (let’s say, probabilistic rules based on distances between somata).
 
4. Establish feedforward inputs into the 10,000 cells representing spike trains incoming from other parts of the brain.  Use arbitrary spike trains (e.g., experimental recordings), if possible.
 
5. Save the constructed system to a file.  Read the file into NetPyNE and run the simulation. 
 
6. Visualize the output.
 
Do you think it’s feasible?  Sorry for a short notice, and please do let me know if this is too much to ask :).
 
Many thanks,
 
Anton.

Hi Anton,

Yes, I think its feasible. 

Were you interested in any particular cell models / number of compartments? any ones available in hoc or python (eg. from ModelDB) can be directly imported. Of course 10k cells with very detailed morphologies might take a while to simulate. In our M1 sim we combine Izhikevich point neurons, 5-compartment, and full >170 compartment cells. Let me know if you'd be interested in seeing an example of this. 

Any requirements in terms of subcellular connectivity? Want single soma to soma synapse, or multiple synapses per cell-to-cell connection? Currently can provide specific section/location for each synapse, or can choose to distribute uniformly across a set of sections or sectionList (also about to release feature to distribute synapses over dendritic tree based on more complex patterns, eg. 1D or 2D density maps). 

I'll let you know if I have any issues, but otherwise talk to you Wednesday 3pm (pacific time). 

Thanks again for your interest.
Salva

Sounds great, Salvador.  Thank you very much.
 
We typically use models with a few hundred compartments.  They all can be found here:
http://celltypes.brain-map.org/
They are also available on ModelDB.
 
Let’s not worry about actually running a simulation with 10,000 cells.  We are just curious to see the workflow and get an idea about the scale of the problem.  If you can estimate how long it will take to run the model-building part, how long it would take to simulate it, and how large are the files in which you would save the model details, that would be great, but don’t worry if it turns out that estimating those numbers is not straightforward.
 
For the connectivity, we are using multiple synapses per connection (let’s assume, five synapses per connection on average).  Synapses should be distributed over dendritic tree, with rules depending on target and source cell types.  For example, something like “for this connection type, place synapses on the soma and dendrites within 100 um of path distance from the soma”.  Again, please don’t worry about actually instantiating all this.  We would just like to see an example of your code that does that.
 
One additional thought we have is that we could ask you for the code from such a tutorial after we talk on Wednesday.  That way we could start playing around with NetPyNE in a meaningful way.  Hope that’s OK.
 
Thanks, and looking forward to chatting soon!  Best,
 
Anton.

- if no gather, then only increases 2mb / iteration

- only happens when multiple cores! related to gather 

- leakage when pc.py_alltoall -- need to clear vars inside func

- small leakage when saving - think reduced by clearing vars

- huge leakge with plotSpikeHist

** issues
- bidirectional
- requires creating synMechs both in presyn and postsyn
- requires creating conns from pre->post and post->pre
- need to do at the network.py level so can call createConn func for both cells
- requires specifying sec and loc of source cell as well as of target cell -- add preSec and preLoc

- create a temporal list with the presyn cells and ids, and create the synMech, target_var and source_var with the
  appropriate ids after connections have been created. 
- check that it plays well with subcellular distributions
- check that no duplicates are created

* 16oct27 Netstims and artif cells as cell populations
- change tutorials
- if artificial cells (spike generators with no section), 'cellModel' refers to point process mech name (can be overriden if
  cellRule with that name)
- check if cellModel=rule, otherwise check if pointprocess, otherwise error 
- use try except to set params
- create oneToOne connectivity -- connect in order 
- backward compatibility issues:
-- netstim pop now requires numCells (default to numCells: 1 ??)
-- connection should be oneToOne (default is fullConn)

- cant check if rules exist for particular cellModel, since could be applied based on other features (eg. yfrac); so have to
  make condition of point process make prioritary: 1st check if cellModel==point process -> PointCell; otherwise CompartCell

I made a new pull request into the development branch as requested. I am using Netpyne to model the Basal Ganglia network
using biophysically detailed and simplified spiking models. I am going to look at the effect of pathological oscillations on
task performance for motor tasks. One of the overarching goals of our group is to combine different models into a multi-scale
model of Basal Ganglia, spinal chord and motor units in the muscles, so I may use Netpyne for that too.  I appreciate all the
work that is made open source by your group. It helped me a lot while learning how to use the more advanced features of
Neuron using Python.  All the best, Lucas

** 16aug17 11:00 MBL bill discuss netpyne with hines - sald notesi []
- value of dictionaries would be a small lambda function that gives generality 

- two things i'd like to see -- notation is reasonable but very descriptive 
-- seems there would be a better way to organize it [similar to NeuroML but shorter; needs to be standardized format]
-- what can be additional value added for the user [easy creation, parallel sim and analysis of net; complex conn patterns simplified; subcellular; inputs]

-- ultimate would the the traub model -- very compact network level description of the traub model 13 cell types, ~128
  projection types -- 128 statements -- shouldn't have to write down the same things -- pij, weight, delay (cf NQS) [conn
  matrix can be converted to netpynec conn rules eg. M1; but need to write down same things so have consistent standard
  format for all nets, eg. some not based on pij, dist-dep, yfrac] 
-- extract all this from the current 15k line code [neuroml version can extract net instance; but will have to check manually
  for high-level conn rules]

- lambda function style encourages compactness; or def if used more than once [can use; string-based more compact and same effect; complexity of lambda: have to include arguments (eg. dist, x loc), not same for all rules]

- on the setup set -- instantiation -- target cells for a particular rank -- only setup on that rank
  due to the sources, building the netcon depends on location of the source; rules have SRC->TARG info so need to use the
  net-rendezvous-rank strategy (a common idiom used to resolve these problems)

- net-rendezvous-rank strategy: used if trying to decide if something exists or not; can't answer question unless all of the
  types exist but they exist randomly distributed across all the ranks so have to gather info from all the ranks; were do we
  meet?  -- we don't meet at a single master;  we are in double loops (for targ over TARG for src over SRC) -- 
  here's the answer:  we rendezvous at target_gid%nhost to decide  [can implement in netpyne]

- bad (but still common) idiom: sometimes useful to do net-rendezvous-rank in 2 phases - build round-robin system first and
  then throw away and rebuild with balanced distribution 

- I mentioned mark hereld example of an interactive HPC (also cf vslice) sim that is managed thru a remote GUI [netpyne GUI,
  OSB gepetto, new NEURON GUI, NSG]

- change name? -- NetPyNe sounds to much like PYNN -- mh also works with Andrew Davison so would like to avoid  the apparent
overlap; domain of PYNN -- metasimulator to construct models in NEURON, NEST, BRIAN, using neuromorophic  simulators
  (spinnaker, analog VLSI); NeuroML, MUSIC (multi-simulator-coordinator == lower level data interchange) in somewhat similar
  domains [mostly phonetic similarity; many python packages have py so similar; discuss with Andrew in Janelia]

 
- look into Nengo -- language used to put together Eliasmith -- prob has a good network connectivity algorithm/layout 
  https://pythonhosted.org/nengo/examples/network_design.html: 'def motor_cortex(command_threshold, n_neurons_per_command=30)'
  https://pythonhosted.org/nengo/examples/network_design_advanced.html?highlight=tips%20tricks [included most of NEST conn
  features + others; Nengo very artificial non-bio eg. implement math funcs using spiking neurons]

- separate issues: advantages of branch failure; cf Paul Rhodes branch point failure [?]

** 16aug26 MBL meeting (sald notes)
*** Reverse engineering
- inverse problem: approximation, computer-aided design
- use GA to aid in the inverse problem
- netpyne can generate initial attempt to inverse network; then user can update the randomizer functions etc based on the
  source code
- modelview gets lowest hangin fruit, but netpyne could do more sophisticated analysis to extract features
- network
-- find cell types
-- connections to other types etc
-- given projection is there a constant/pattern that can be reverse engineered, convergence
- Try out example of reverse engineering -- maybe CA3 model
- reverse engineer data - eg. M1 model have physio + conns and turn into model
- netpyne can import cells from hoc template or cell class instance
- people have done before -- create model that generates data, and from data use Bayesian learning to infer params
- 1000 noisy channels, get data and do experiments to get back params of sodium channels back
- eg. get maximal conductance param from data - maximum likelihood (won't be same since noise)
- hidden parameters that have to be informed - markov model 
- process noise + experimental noise - log likelihood 
- always wrong - only approximation

- 3 approaches:
-- 1) current modeldb - get approx same rule
-- 2) GA - get different rule from original 
-- 3) BRAIN (reality)

*** Evolutionary
- What to optimize
-- 1) GA - Learning params (eg. learning rate)
-- 2) High-level specs (eg. prob of conn)
-- 3) Network instance params (eg. explicit weights) 

- What to invert from GA generated network
-- 1) High-level specs (eg. prob of conn)
-- 2) Dynamical properties (can be used to fit)

*** Aim 1
- Brett et al 

*** grant approach
- we have done this in the last 5 years - can we do this for the next 5 years

- significance
- innovation
- investigator


*** redefine aims
- Aim 1: front end
-- GUI
-- dendritic connectivity

- Aim 2: back end
-- rendezvous

- not good - front vs back

- make Aim 2: parallelization
-- parallelize setup - rendezvous
-- load balance
-- parameter optimization (evol etc)

*** subworlds
- set of nodes working on same networks
- can have 10 subworlds, each for 1 net
- bulletin board - old 1994 - currently master but could be done as distributed bulletin baoard

*** GUI
- interface to create network
- 
- simtracker managing of sims
- simtracker summary of model data

** 16aug26 Bill notes
*** get output of modelview to read the flat instantiated model but currently doesn't do networks well
*** Aim3 modelview outputs a small subset of cells (sees different templated / ?classes) and can export to netpyne 
finds commonality also by common parameters, morphologies
random values in 1 location -- can't currently find it -- could find distributions but can't find random seed (a cryptographic solution)
does the netpyne and original create the same net -- Sub## are two networks identical
Sub## netpyne description of the flat file -- straightforward
subroutines for inverting random distros --- eg sampling without replacement -- if pick 50 out of 1000 
*** can apply GA to the high level expression -- 
NetPyNe expresses it and modelview interprets it 
*** LEMS, LEMD (low entropy model description)
*** current traub 20k fortran model to 20k hoc model 
*** often have to factor out what is different among very similar fragments
*** should we start with the single cell?  -- could that be the main piece to do here Sub3.x 
cell build session file vs netpyne description; hoc file written by cell builder
cell templates are usually never touched -- get a few
PRELIM Data -- netpyne currently create instances and then reads those instances
*** what are the metrics of similarity? -- how are we going to compare whether the output is good enough
not currently much randomness in the modeldb models
*** networks have been very program specific in the past and network construction is embodied in the code -- 1st step is to
get rid of code accidents
*** Aim3.x --- CAD vs fully automated
CAD -- stick randomizer here 
universals -- number of cells, how many types (small # of types based on morphology with minor variations)
modelview currently only gets the lowest of low hanging
*** same heuristics that are used for cells can be used for networks - whole pool of connections
1. draw circles around all the types; 
2. in that type are there connection to every other type or to a few types
3. given a projection is there a constant or a distribution (make some usual assumptions -- eg, no 2 projections to 1 cell --
without replacement);  what are the statistics of the projections; what those 35 cells are is random ?
*** try one with 3 types - CA3 -- try to catch up with ernie
*** HBP - read in 1e4 morphologies of 100 morphoelectric sites and Peter's principal 
*** BRAIN -> modeldb -> we will reverse engineer M1 which we're already doing
*** figure of merit -- size of the original code vs size of the final netpyne description
*** how to create the network -- how to grow networks; growing networks; find some emergent rules
just use GA on a set of parameters -- cell params and weights
learning network -- RL or other, homeostatic plasticity 
grow from axon growth cone rules  -- or GA on probabilities
2 step growning -- grow the learning rules and then grow the network
emergent properties -- dynamical properties, properties of network organization (not an inverse problem)
  do the netpyne solutions give networks with dynamical properties that are similar to that seen with the grown network
*** a lot of times algorithms for analysis need to look at places that you have the answer -- you don't care that it's not
exact; need to see that 
reduction problem from a 3D net to a stylized
Bush and Sejnowsi -- reduce to a small cell that captures the dynamics of the big cell  (Pinsky and Rinzel, Michele, Ted, HBP)
*** approach of having a test example of algorithms -- explore algorithms used for optimization - does your fitness function
of getting back an optimal similar to the other model -- Sean Carver did this Bayesian optimization of ion channels
1. develop a model (HH type channel model); 2. output data; 3. learn model with Bayesian algorithm from single channel data
1000 Na channels so a noisy set -- what experiments can you do on this system to get back the parameters of the channel
Bayesian == maximum likelihood -- a parameterized model ; a noisy system; let's say only param is gbar -- let's retrieve it
orig data had randomness in it -- any model could create this but likelihood is low if the params isn't correct but even if
correct won't get the data exactly since seed wasn't same
practical difficulty 
markov model contained some hidden parameters so that had some states for which had no data
one problem with least squares on trajectories is that least squares depends on the 'fact' that every point on the curve is
  independent ; it's a curve not a bunch of random points -- least squares is missing the parameterization
*** two kinds of noise -- process noise and experimental noise (artifact)
forcing it to be on the original data trajectory -- what's the likelihood that it's actually on that trajectory -- extremely
small so work with log(likelihood)
*** doing an AP in a model -- you are close to threshold so any kid of noise will cause a spike at any time or no spike at all
*** statistical philosophy -- you can take any amount of data out of my distribution; want to know the mean of my distro
  can take different ones and end up with a lot of means -- is your distribution of means which should be gaussian? what is
  distro of the mean -- this now is recursive
mean can be very different from what you find
expectation value if the anomalous card had a very large value associated with it
maximum likelihood - 95% likelihood but now can run 1e6 times and see ideally would see that 95% but only see 90% so is 90%
close enough to 95% so that that is the same follow
*** new way of organizing grants -- this is what we published in last 5 years -- is this good enough to continue
*** LEMD == low-entropy model description, simplified model description, high-level model description, logical model description
*** Aim 1 RxD part is innovative
subcellular connectivity -- dendritic connectivity; deal with regions of the cell
have to define the regions -- make a description that is indep of the specific morphology
NeuronDB canonical cells -- medial proximal distal; basal apical axonal; 1st order, 2nd order, 3rd order; yfrac, distances from soma
linear dec in IH, IA are functions of distance from soma
do we want to find basilar dendrites? -- define cells 
*** hoc uses strings and python traditionally uses callables but we're using strings here; lambdas are not particularly interesting
give an explain as to why we use strings rather than lambda func -- nothing exists until it's instantiated
*** why do we use python -- python gives flexibility for things like error checking interactively
*** arbitrary keys (with arbitrary values) can be used in values
*** Aim 4: GUI enter rules into a form that computes the netpyne file
fill in the blanks
pictorial stuff - drag&drop? 
problems of the outsider -- what is the meaning of the terms that are obvious to the inventor? -- eg probability defined by a sin function??
incorporate -- pdf -- probability distribution function
biased distribution since no cells with too many or too few connections -- use convergence or divergence in netpyne
*** how to do parallel setup -- integrate rendezvous rank in netpyne so all the implicit loops are parallel loops
*** split up aims based on User Experience: Aim 1 -- include GUI?) 
vs Aim 2: BackEnd -- parallel setup (rendezvous rank, use hash to find the node where you will rendezvous), evolutionary algorithms, 
(5,3,7).__hash__()%1024 # 87 so can rendezvous on 14 -- #40 wants that and #375 has it so can find out where to send
  (send the key of key:value or send the hash)
collecting data can also use this use %10 to collect 10 files in 10 places
*** instantiating on 64k nodes -- everyone has the description but no one can see the whole model
can get in TACC or SDSC
*** running tests and benchmarks -- standard tests
*** outer loop of targets (exist on a particular node), inner loop of sources 
   does everyone need to know about all targets -- we hope not
gid contains no information about the cell unless you ask for it
*** can hash the dict for describing a pop2pop connection -- node has a target or set of targets that know what set of sources
they are looking for -- the source population doesn't exist anywhere (it's just a conceptual object; NB the source population
(or target pop) will not fit on any node)  -- src gids have to declare themselves and made note of their node location
NO - not so easy since the rules at the target will be intersections and unions of rules known at a source
UHOH being when src->targ based on distance and then only define based on relation of src to targ
pc.gidconnect(srcgid)
for cell in targets: for netpyne_sources ,,,,
relationship of target to source -- no common hash -- each one has a hash -- the target knows what sources it's looking for
and the sources know what targets it's looking for
*** distance -- can be handled in general - the hash is the rule -- everyone now in the same place -- the master
handle with a specialized algorithm;  any rule that involves pruning is ok; as long as only get a reasonable size subet
*** testing on megamachines is one reason we want to have a bunch of models to work with -- Traub, CA3, M1, Soltesz
*** Aim 2 could be parallel assistance, fun with parallel
1. rendezvous rank for setup
2. load balance -- can always reduce to a round robin
3. parameter optimization evolve,GA (subworlds)
*** subworlds: doing allgather needs to be restricted to a subset of ranks so that those are doing the same problem
then use bulletin board to throw out the networks -- bulletin board is a master/worker style of computation
  could do bulletin board as a 'distributed bulletin board' (could be wasteful) -- Linda idea was distributed BB
extremes is 1 subworld or 1 node per network and all bulletin board
*** what are the modern ideas for distributed databases 
*** model, view, controller
*** graphical introspection -- what created this graph? -- do something by analogy; find something similar to what you want to do and modify
*** declarative programming vs procedural -- Backus notation
http://maude.cs.uiuc.edu/maude2-manual/html/maude-manualch1.html
is there a grammar of networks?  can we invent one?  would it be useful?  -- NO, NO, NO
the more that things correspond to reality the more likely they are to persist whereas when you are abstract a slight change
  in perspective obviates the prior results
*** Nengo -- draw lines between networks
*** representation of the network instance -- exhaustive --- each cell has the full set of properties repeated or reference to
some shared prototype -- each of the cells which are closely related have a shared representation with separate randomizers
*** appropriate scaling -- typically scale down the weights if increase the convergence with increased network size
once you get up to 1e4 no longer allow more convergence with increased network size
scale is critical for debugging since need to work with a small networks or hybrid networks
reduce to ART_CELLS --- can do that
*** generate the network and save the network -- save to disk, save on subworlds, modify a model in netpyne
remove a cell and dump the network back to netpyne -- idea of cell death different from another indstance of the network

** 16dec02 meeting at yale
- This tool will subsequently be expanded to allow it to automate the process of employing new data being gathered by ongoing
  efforts (BRAIN, HBP, Allen) to define specific brain networks and their cellular constituents. 
-- eveything data-driven, clarify to what extent 

- NEURON, including the intracellular molecular reaction chains for metabotropic synapses, a level of detail not provided by
  most neural  simulators. We are also building in the ability to readily handle variant hybrid networks, where some cells
  are modeled in great detail (MC cells)
-- 

- All of the parts, all of this complexity, will remain under the umbrella of a single conceptual model designed using
  NetPyNE
--

- NetPyNE already supports the use of a simple spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) mechanism, which has been used to
  develop a model of sensorimotor cortex that learns to drive a musculoskeletal arm model via reinforcement learning.

- provide facilities for readily varying hybrid networks so that, for example, the many runs needed for parameter exploration
  would be done with only a few MC cells,
-- still complicated to switch in a biological sense -- need to take into account if connections change as a func of more
biophys cell model
-- computer-assisted

- SA1 - comparison of original Traub model with netpyne version

- Dont have space to put everyhting or say already done it -- appropriate prelim results that give credibility to what you
  are going to do:
-- eg. Traub model

- Netpyne is an organizational method for promoting conceptual control
-- the more compact, lower entropy 
-- tends toward entropy, but also organizes into conceptual blocks without having the whole model in your head

- without programming expertise - red flags
-- use templates, can change parameters in isolated ways

- high-level parameters to describe complex synaptic distribution
-- include figs of sCRACM -> syn distribution

- code optimization methods might be required to make the process feasible
-- algorithmic optimization

- A second premise is that there is not enough memory in any one process to hold a mapofwhichranksholdwhichobjects.
-- a map supplied by single process does not scale

- example of within dependent pre-and post-synaptic cell condition -- = not dist dependent

- The simple random distribution of cells evenly on all processors provides a performance baseline for comparison with more
  sophisticated distribution algorithms, such as dynamic load balance and least processing time algorithm 
-- only used round-robin or least-processing time

- However, it transiently requires twice the memory of the model, does not handle (the rare case) of mod files that use
  POINTER, and typically shows no improvement for single thread models
-- not true, significant

gid compression is only available if each processor owns fewer than 256 cells
- 16 -- from 12 to 2 -- could be to 3 or 4

- the NEURON Subworlds feature has not been extensively used or tested and is based on an old implementation. Its efficiency
should be evaluated and the implementation improved if deemed necessary.
bulletin board does nto scale because of master rank -- 

- remove grid search

- reverse eng - spy skulduggery -- remove


** Questions 
*** GPU will be available for all users of just HBP? include in grant that netpyne will support?
- yes will be available in core neuron - so open source, can be added to netpyne
*** load balancing techniques? papers 

*** Netpyne integrated with NEURON?


* TODO (moved to Github issues - 16may31)
** DONE - unify cellmodel 
- cell prop conditions: 
-- cellType=RS; cellModel=HH
-- cellType=RS; cellModel=Izhi
- provide option to insert distribute mechanism or point process
- single cell class 
- then add support for 2007a - spikes+record from izh._ref_V

- INCLUDE BOTH HH AND IZHI IN SAME RULE AND USE CELLMODEL TAG IN CELL TO CHOOSE WHICH TO USE!!

** DONE - Overwrite files optional (timestamp)
** DONE - Default simConfig
** DONE - Import cells with generic set of arguments
** DONE - Use mechanismType to make importCell more robust
https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/static/new_doc/modelspec/programmatic/mechtype.html
https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/static/new_doc/programming/mechstan.html
http://neurosimlab.org/ramcd/pyhelp/mechstan.html#MechanismStandard - 2nd example

- use params with initial underscore '_var' to indicate used by netpyne, not mechanism/pointprocess variable - add to docu!
** DONE Check Izhi2007a
** DONE Distinguish syns from other point processes 
- no way to do it
- assume 'syn' in name -- establish naming convention -- added to doc

- syn: true, false, false (.is_netcon_target() = True; .has_net_event(i) = False; .is_artificial() = false)
- artcell: true, true?, true
- izh2007a: true, true, false
- izhi2007b: true, false, false

MechanismType.is_netcon_target()
Syntax:
boolean =  mt.is_netcon_target(i)
Description:
The i'th point process has a NET_RECEIVE block and can therefore be a target for a NetCon object.

MechanismType.has_net_event() 
Syntax:
boolean = mt.has_net_event(i)
Description:
The i'th point process has a net_event call in its NET_RECEIVE block and can therefore be a source for a NetCon object. This
means it is NetCon stimulator or that the point process can be used as an artificial neural network cell.

MechanismType.is_artificial() 
Syntax:
boolean = mt.is_artificial(i)
Description:
The i'th point process is an ARTIFICIAL_CELL and can therefore be a source for a NetCon object. This means it is NetCon stimulator or that the point process can be used as an artificial neural network cell.

This seems to have, but does not, equivalent functionality to has_net_event() and was introduced because ARTIFICIAL_CELL
objects are no longer located in sections. Some ARTIFICIAL_CELLs such as the PatternStim do not make use of net_event in
their implementation, and some PointProcesses do use net_event and must be located in sections for their proper function,
e.g. reciprocal synapses.

** DONE Make list of data saved part of simCfg
- simConfig, netParams, net, simData
- added to docu

** DONE Test importing Friesen, mainen, traub cell models
- Read python names in importCell
-- use dir; check if section; compare with secList

- 'synReceptor' check for syn type not name

** DONE Associate_gid from axon
- section['spikeGenLoc'] = 0.5

     6 	: refer to v or any ions or have a POINTER. It is entirely isolated
     7 	: and depends on discrete events from the outside to affect it and
     8 	: affects the outside only by sending discrete events.
