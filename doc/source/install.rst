Installation
=======================================


Requirements 
------------------------------------------------------

Before installing NetPyNE, please ensure you have the following installed:

1) Python 2 or 3 (2.7, 3.6 and 3.7 are supported). Download from the `official Python website <https://www.python.org/>`_. Alternatively, you can download the `Anaconda Distribution <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`_ which also includes several data science and visualization packages.

2) The ``pip`` tool for installing Python packages. See `pip installation here <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`_.

3) The NEURON simulator. See NEURON's `installation instructions <http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/download/>`_. If you would like to run parallelized simulations, please ensure you install NEURON with MPI support (see also `Quick start guide <https://neuron.yale.edu/ftp/neuron/2019umn/neuron-quickstart.pdf>`_). Note: the latest NEURON version can be installed simply via: ``pip install neuron``



Install the latest released version of NetPyNE via pip (Recommended)
------------------------------------------------------

Linux or Mac OS:  ``pip install netpyne`` 

Windows: ``python -m pip install netpyne``


Upgrade to the latest released version of NetPyNE via pip
------------------------------------------------------

Use this option if you already have NetPyNE installed and just want to update to the latest version.

Linux or Mac OS: ``pip install netpyne -U``

Windows: ``python -m pip install -U netpyne`` 


Install the development version of NetPyNE via GitHub and pip
------------------------------------------------------

The NetPyNE package source files, as well as example models, are available via GitHub at: https://github.com/Neurosim-lab/netpyne. The following instructions will install the version in the GitHub "development" branch -- it will include some of the latest enhancements and bug fixes, but could also include temporary bugs:

1) ``git clone https://github.com/Neurosim-lab/netpyne.git``
2) ``cd netpyne``
3) ``git checkout development``
4) ``pip install -e .``

pip will add a symlink in the default Python packages directory to the cloned NetPyNE directory (so you don't need to modify PYTHONPATH). If new changes are available just need to ``git pull`` from the cloned NetPyNE directory.

This version can also be used by developers interested in extending the package. 

.. _install_gui:

Use a browser-based online version of NetPyNE GUI (beta version)
------------------------------------------------------

The NetPyNE GUI is available online at: `gui.netpyne.org <http://gui.netpyne.org>`_. There is a maximum number of simultaneous users for this online version, so if you can't log in, please try again later. 

Note: the GUI also includes an interactive Python Jupyter Notebook (click "Python" icon at bottom-left) that you can use to directly run NetPyNE code/models (i.e. without using the actual graphical interface). 

Installation Troubleshooting
------------------------------------------------------
If you have any issues during the installation please post a message with the details to the `NetPyNE forum <http://www.netpyne.org/forum>`_ or the `NetPyNE GitHub issues <https://github.com/Neurosim-lab/netpyne/issues>`_ .
