# M1NetworkModel
## Description
This example is based on the multiscale model of mouse primary motor cortex (M1) example.
In the init.py function it shows code on how to use the interval saving function and save the synWeights periodically.
The key differences are the use of intervalRun and effectively defining two intervals, one for saving weights and one
saving the data. Note also, the use of fileGather instead of gather.

Developed using NetPyNE (www.neurosimlab.org/netpyne)

## Setup and execution

This example is meant to be use withe the M1detailed exampled temporarily replace the init and cfg files in that example and run as normal
